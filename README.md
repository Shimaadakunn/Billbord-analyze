Top musics data analysis using panda dataframe
========

I treated the data with those 3 steps.
- Data cleaning

    By removing na, duplicates and reordering it
    
- Data analysis 
    
    By extracting correlation heatmap, trying to find the country of origin of the music via the name of song and artist...

- Learning from this data
    
    And trying to find the importance of each data in the learning
